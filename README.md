# *`cleopatra`*

*`cleopatra`* is a generic, extensible toolchain for literate programming
projects using [Org mode](https://orgmode.org/) and more.

## Getting Started

The annoying thing with *`cleopatra`* is that we need *`cleopatra`* to build
it. To build it, you can use the `exported` branch.

```
git checkout exported
cargo install --path .
```
