We introduce cleopatra, a generic, extensible toolchain with facilities for
literate programming projects using [[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]] and more.  The key concept of
*~cleopatra~* is to write so-called generation processes as Makefile rules.

The present document presents the source code of *~cleopatra~*
call_cleopatra-version().

- [[file:cleopatra-crate.org][1 – The cleopatra Crate]] ::
  Users interact with *~cleopatra~* through a command-line tool implemented in
  Rust. This chapter describes its implementation.
- [[file:cleopatra-elisp.org][2 — cleopatra’s Elisp Package]] ::
  Under the hood, Cleopatra relies on Emacs to tangle the Org documents which
  specify user-defined generation processes. This chapter describes the
  Elisp configuration code used to that end.
- [[file:build-process.org][3 — Build Process]] ::
  Generation processes in *~cleopatra~* are primilarly Makefiles with a
  particular structure. In this chapter, we describe the “build sequence” of
  *~cleopatra~*, and the helpers which make it happen.
- [[file:procs.org][4 — cleopatra by Examble]] ::
  *~cleopatra~* is a literate programming project itself, and is actually
  bootstrapped. This chapter describes the generation processes used to build
  both *~cleopatra~* and its documentation.
- [[file:commons.org][5 — cleopatra’s Library of Babel]] ::
  Cleopatra is implemented using the literate programming paradigm. In
  particular, we use the ~noweb~ feature of Babel. This chapter introduces
  several source block that can be evaluated by Emacs at tangling and exporting
  time to generate part of the project.
