#+AUTHOR: Thomas Letan

We introduce *~cleopatra~*, a generic, extensible toolchain for literate
programming project using [[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]].  The key concept of *~cleopatra~* is to
write so-called generation processes as Makefile rules.

- [[file:cleopatra-crate.org][1 – The Cleopatra Crate]] ::
  Users interact with *~cleopatra~* through a command-line tool implemented in
  Rust. This chapter describes its implementation.
- [[file:commons.org][2 — Cleopatra’s Library of Babel]] ::
  Cleopatra is implemented using the literate programming paradigm. In
  particular, we use the ~noweb~ feature of Babel. This chapter introduces
  several source block that can be evaluated by Emacs at tangling and exporting
  time to generate part of the project.
