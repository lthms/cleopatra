Since *~cleopatra~* is far from being the single available build tool (it is
merely an overlay on an existing one, actually!), we avoid ambiguity by fixing a
small, but consistent terminology.

- Root :: The directory which contains the ~cleopatra.toml~ file, and supposedly
  the root of the source tree of the software built by *~cleopatra~*.
- Workspace :: The private directory of *~cleopatra~* (~.cleopatra/~).
- Generation Process :: An Org document describing a set of build recipes, along
  with the auxiliary files used by these rules.
- Build Process :: How *~cleopatra~* leverages the generation processes supplied
  by her users to actually build their projects.
